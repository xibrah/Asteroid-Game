This is a great start for your Asteroid Frontier RPG game! Let me explain what we've built so far:

## Game Structure

The code is organized into several interconnected systems:

1. **Main Game Module**: Integrates all the systems and handles the game loop
2. **Character System**: Manages player and NPC characters, their stats, and inventories
3. **Map System**: Handles level layouts and navigation
4. **Dialogue and Quest System**: Manages conversations and mission tracking
5. **Item and Inventory System**: Tracks items, equipment, and currency
6. **Space Travel System**: Facilitates travel between different locations

## Key Features Implemented

- **Character Progression System**: Characters have stats, skills, and can level up
- **Robust Dialogue System**: NPCs can have branching conversations with the player
- **Quest Management**: Complete with objectives, rewards, and reputation impacts
- **Inventory Management**: Item categorization, usage, and stacking
- **Space Travel System**: Travel between locations with random encounters
- **Solar System Map**: Visual representation of the Asteroid Frontier universe

## Game World

The game includes locations from your Asteroid Frontier universe:
- **Psyche Township**: Main hub with characters like Stella, Gus, and #27
- **The Rusty Rocket**: Bar on Ceres with Ruby and CV
- **Other Locations**: Pallas, Vesta, Luna, and Mars

## How to Run the Game

To run this game, you would need to:

1. Set up a Python environment with Pygame installed
2. Create the directory structure for assets
3. Run the main game file

## Next Steps for Development

Here are some next steps to consider:

1. **Asset Creation**: Add sprites for characters, items, and environments
2. **Combat System**: Implement encounters with enemies from your universe
3. **Advanced Quests**: Create more complex quest chains tied to your story
4. **Ship Management**: Add a system for upgrading and customizing the player's ship
5. **Faction System**: Develop more complex faction relationships and reputation effects

The code is modular and extensible, making it easy to expand with new features as you develop the game further.

Would you like me to explain any particular part of the code in more detail, or shall we discuss next steps for expanding your Asteroid Frontier RPG?

Notes:
requires Pygame, install with: pip intall pygame
